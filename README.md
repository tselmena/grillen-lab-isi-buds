# grillen-lab-isi-buds
Continuation of work from ISI-BUDS 2025. Instructing efficient early phase preclinical Alzheimer’s disease trials.

This repository contains 5 folders: 
1) analysis
2) data
3) documentation 
4) figures
5) helpers

Folders `data` and `documentation` are unmodified from the `A4SecondaryAnalysis` folder. 
They remain as they originally came from the A4 study. See `documentation` for 
data dictionaries as well as references used for the vignette and spline plot. 

`analysis` contains `data-processing-and-calculations.qmd`. This Quarto document 
cleans the data that was used for the entire analysis. In addition to data processing,
you will also find calculations for sample size, AUC, and the uni-test logistic
regression models. 

`figures` contains `plots.qmd` and `tables.qmd`. 
**Before attempting to run either file, please run data-processing-and-calculations.qmd**. 
`plots.qmd` contains all plots used in the presentation, as well as some additional EDA. 
`tables.qmd` contains publication-style tables used in the presentation. In addition,
it also contains the latex equations used in the presentation under Appendix. 
Please note that it does **not** contain the Table 1. 

`helpers` contains two .R scripts, `01-load-libraries.R` and `02-functions.R`. 
They are called at the beginning of `data-processing-and-calculations.qmd`. 
`01-load-libraries.R` loads all necessary libraries for running the analysis. 
`02-functions.R` contain 5 function definitions and documentation for 
processing the data and running calculations. 

All work in this folder was written by Tselmen Anuurad, unless otherwise noted.

# Instructing Efficient Early Phase Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease Trials
A Secondary Analysis of A4 Study Data

## About This Project
This repository contains the complete analysis for the "Instructing Efficient Early Phase Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease Trials" project, a continuation of work from ISI-BUDS 2025. The analysis involves processing data from the A4 study to calculate sample sizes, compare predictive models using AUC, and generate plots and tables for publication.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:

* **/analysis**: Contains the main Quarto documents for the analysis.
    * `data-processing-and-calculations.qmd`: **This is the main script.** It handles all data cleaning, processing, and calculations (sample size, AUC, uni-test logistic regression).
    * `plots.qmd`: Generates all figures used in the presentation.
    * `tables.qmd`: Generates all publication-style tables and contains LaTeX appendix equations.

* **/data**: Data Not Included. Due to its size, the A4 study data is not stored in this repository. The analysis scripts expect a `data` folder that contains the three original subfolders of `A4_ClinicalData` named `External Data`, `Derived Data`, and `Raw Data`. The path should look like `data/External Data/`, `data/Derived Data/`, and `data/Raw Data/`.

* **/documentation**: Contains original A4 study documentation, including data dictionaries and references.

* **/figures**: The output folder for plots generated by `plots.qmd`.

* **/helpers**: Contains R scripts that are sourced by the main analysis file.
    * `01-load-libraries.R`: Loads all required R packages.
    * `02-functions.R`: Contains 5 functions used for data processing and calculations.

## How to Run the Analysis (Workflow)
To reproduce the analysis and generate all figures and tables:

1.  **Set up the data folder**. Place the contents into the `/data` directory at the root of this project. Also, ensure all required libraries listed in `helpers/01-load-libraries.R` are installed.
2.  **Run the main processing script first.** Open and run all chunks in `analysis/data-processing-and-calculations.qmd`. This will create the necessary data objects and save them to the environment.
3.  **Generate figures and tables.** Once the main script is complete, you can run the files in any order:
    * Run `analysis/plots.qmd` to generate the plots.
    * Run `analysis/tables.qmd` to generate the tables.
